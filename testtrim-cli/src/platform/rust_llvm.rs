// objects, so we store and optimize our data differently, (b) we don't need fine-grained region-specific coverage
// counts at this time.
//
// As a downside, this implementation is nowhere close to being fine-grained -- if we wanted to get branch-level detail
// we'd need to reimplement (or adapt) the expression-based suppoed that CoverageMapping implemetns.  But while we might
// go function-level in the future, branch-level is quite optimistic.

// CoverageMapping for what we're doing wrong.
